# Neural_Network_Based_Collaborative_Filtering
- Model replaces the inner product between latent vectors in the Matrix Factorization technique with a deep neural network. The neural network learns non-linear mapping between latent vectors and their interaction value.
- This repository has three different implementations
  - ### Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF)
      - This is a generalised version of Matrix Factorization, where it decides(through learning) which element of the latent vector to be weighted more.
